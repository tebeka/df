I'm trying to learn about generics by create a data frame. It's a structure that holds several columns, each column can contain a different type.

For the column I'm using:

```
type Value interface {
	constraints.Ordered | time.Duration
}

type Column[T Value] []T
```

And then for the frame I'd like to do

```
type Frame struct {
	columns []Column
}
```

This of course won't compile:

```
./frame.go:4:12: cannot use generic type Column[T Value] without instantiation
```

Is there a way to specify a slice of Column, each with different T?

Thanks (full code at https://github.com/tebeka/df)
